In this directory, all I do is implement my learnings on trading strategies.
A friend told me it's better to combine two strategies together to achieve something better.

## Strategies
Here's a list of common trading strategies, along with a brief description 
of each and an analysis of their typical risk and profitability ratings:

### Trend Following

**Description:** This strategy involves identifying and following market trends. 
Traders buy securities when prices are trending upwards and sell (or short-sell) 
when trending downwards.
**Risk Rating:** Medium. It relies on sustained market movements, which can 
reverse unexpectedly.
**Profitability Rating:** Medium. Effective in markets with clear trends but 
may underperform in range-bound or choppy markets.

### Mean Reversion:

**Description:** Based on the assumption that prices will revert to their historical 
average. Traders buy undervalued assets and sell overvalued ones, 
expecting a return to mean prices.
**Risk Rating:** Medium. Misjudging the mean or a change in fundamental 
conditions can lead to losses.
**Profitability Rating:** Medium. It can be profitable in stable markets but 
risky during times of significant market shifts.

### Momentum Trading:

**Description:** Involves buying securities that have been rising and selling those 
that are falling, under the assumption that the price movements will continue.
**Risk Rating:** High. Prices can reverse rapidly, and momentum stocks are often 
more volatile.
**Profitability Rating:** High. Potentially high returns, especially in bull 
markets, but also high risk.

### Statistical Arbitrage:

**Description:** A quantitative approach that seeks to exploit price inefficiencies 
between related assets through complex mathematical models.
**Risk Rating:** Medium to High. Requires sophisticated models and rapid execution; 
risks include model failures and market changes.
**Profitability Rating:** Medium to High. Can be highly profitable, but 
effectiveness depends on model accuracy and market conditions.

## Pair Trading:

**Description:** Involves simultaneously buying and selling two related 
securities (like stocks in the same sector) when their prices diverge 
anomalously, betting they will converge again.
**Risk Rating:** Medium. Risks include divergence widening or not reverting in the expected timeframe.
**Profitability Rating:** Medium. Lower risk compared to other strategies but requires precise execution.

### Options Strategies (like Covered Calls or Protective Puts):

**Description:** Involves using options to hedge or speculate on stock movements. 
Covered calls for income generation and protective puts for downside protection are common.
**Risk Rating:** Varies. From low (for conservative strategies like covered calls) 
to high (for speculative plays).
**Profitability Rating:** Varies. Options can offer high returns but require understanding 
of complex pricing and risk factors.

### Machine Learning-Based Strategies:

**Description:** Utilizes algorithms that can learn from and make predictions based on data. Can include a variety of techniques from simple regression to complex neural networks.
**Risk Rating:** High. Depends on the quality of the model and data; prone to overfitting.
**Profitability Rating:** Medium to High. Potential for high returns if models are accurate but requires sophisticated understanding of machine learning.

### Scalping:

**Description:** A strategy where traders profit from small price changes, often making many trades in a single day.
**Risk Rating:** High. Requires constant monitoring and quick decision-making.
**Profitability Rating:** Medium. Profits are small on a per-trade basis and costs (like transaction fees) can be significant.

### Swing Trading:

**Description:** Focuses on profiting from short to medium-term price swings in the market. Traders hold positions for several days to several weeks.
**Risk Rating:** Medium. Exposed to overnight and weekend market risk.
**Profitability Rating:** Medium. Can be profitable but requires skill in identifying potential swings.

### Arbitrage:

**Description:** Exploits price differences of the same asset in different markets or exchanges.
**Risk Rating:** Low to Medium. Main risks are execution risk and the disappearance of the price gap.
**Profitability Rating:** Low to Medium. Arbitrage opportunities are often quickly closed by the market.
