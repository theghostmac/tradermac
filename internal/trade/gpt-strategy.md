Combining multiple trading strategies to achieve a balanced, profit-seeking approach is 
indeed a sensible idea, especially in the context of options trading. Here's a strategy that blends 
elements of mean reversion and trend following, tailored for the options market:

### Combined Strategy: Mean Reversion with Trend Confirmation

#### 1. **Mean Reversion Component**:
- **Idea**: Identify options that are significantly deviating from their historical average implied volatility (IV). This could indicate they are overbought or oversold.
- **Implementation**: Calculate a moving average (e.g., 30-day) of the IV for each option. If the current IV is significantly higher or lower than this average (defined by a threshold, say 2 standard deviations), it signals a potential mean reversion opportunity.

#### 2. **Trend Following Component**:
- **Idea**: Confirm the mean reversion signal with a trend direction indicator of the underlying asset. This ensures we are aligned with the broader market movement.
- **Implementation**: Use a simple moving average crossover system (e.g., 50-day and 200-day moving averages) on the underlying asset. If the short-term average is above the long-term average, it indicates an uptrend, and vice versa.

#### 3. **Trade Execution**:
- **For Overbought Options (IV significantly above average)**:
    - If the underlying asset is in an uptrend, consider selling call options (bearish view on overpriced options).
    - If the underlying asset is in a downtrend, consider buying put options (bearish view aligns with market trend).
- **For Oversold Options (IV significantly below average)**:
    - If the underlying asset is in an uptrend, consider buying call options (bullish view aligns with market trend).
    - If the underlying asset is in a downtrend, consider selling put options (bullish view on underpriced options).

#### 4. **Risk Management**:
- Set stop-loss and take-profit levels based on your risk tolerance.
- Regularly monitor and adjust positions based on changing market conditions.

#### Implementation in Go:

You'll need to implement several components in your Go codebase:

1. **IV Calculation Module**: Calculate the implied volatility of options and its moving average.

2. **Moving Average Module for Underlying Asset**: Calculate moving averages for the underlying asset to determine the trend.

3. **Signal Generator**: Based on the above modules, generate signals for potential trades.

4. **Trade Execution Logic**: Implement logic to execute trades based on generated signals, considering current market prices and portfolio holdings.

5. **Risk Management System**: Incorporate a system to manage the risk of each trade.

This strategy aims to exploit short-term inefficiencies in the options market while aligning with the longer-term trend 
of the underlying asset, seeking to balance profit potential with risk management. Remember, all trading strategies 
carry risk, and it's crucial to backtest thoroughly using historical data before live implementation. 
Additionally, continually monitor and adjust the strategy as market conditions change.
