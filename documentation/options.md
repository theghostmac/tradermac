The strike price of an option is a fixed price at which the owner of the option can buy ("call" option)
or sell ("put" option) the underlying security of commodity.

It may be gotten by either of two ways:
- get the spot price (the current market price).
- fixed as a discount or a premium.

## Moneyness

It is the difference between the strike price of the option and the current trading price 
of the underlying security.

Moneyness is described using _in-the-money_, _at-the-money_, and _out-of-the-money_.
- a call option is _in-the-money_ if the strike price is below the market price of the underlying.
- a put option is _in-the-money_ if the strike price is above the market price of the underlying.
- a call or put option is _at-the-money_ if the underlying price and stock price are the equal or similar.
- a call option is _out-of-the-money_ if the strike price is above the market price.
- a put option is _out-of-the-money_ if the strike price is below the market price.
